		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		Think <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">Hackathon</a> for designers, developers and creatives. We cram the most talented, creative people in all of Louisiana in a room with a ton of caffeine for 24 hours. In that time, Designers, Developers, Copywriters and Marketers will produce a full brand and web presence for a lucky non-profit program or project that we've selected. This year's Designathon is generously sponsored by the great people at <a href="http://envoc.com">Envoc</a>!
